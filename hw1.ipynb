    "This notebook contains the programming part of HW 1. In the first problem, you will build two trigram language models for Yelp reviews, one that operates at the word-level and another that operates on the level of individual characters. You will then use these language models to generate sample Yelp reviews. In the second problem, you will build naive bayes classifiers to distinguish between legitimate news headlines and clickbait.\n",

    "Now you need to train your language models on these reviews. You need to implement the class ```NGramLM```. First, **fill in** the function ```get_ngram_counts``` to process the reviews and get the counts of all unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and possibly four-grams (if character-level) in the reviews. You need to store the counts in the dictionary ```self.ngram_count```. This dictionary will contain dictionaries as values. For example, ```self.ngram_count[0]``` will be a dictionary containing all of the unigrams, and ```self.ngram_count[1]``` will be a dictionary containing all the bigrams.\n",

    "- Convert all letters to lowercase.\n",
    "- Tokenize each review. Use a word-level tokenizer (such as ```nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize```) for the word-level model and a character-level tokenizer (such as ```char_tokenizer```, defined below) for the character-level model. Do not split BOS and EOS tokens.\n",
    "- You will need to make the function ```get_ngram_counts``` flexible enough so that (1) it can operate on both the character-level and the word-level and (2) it can operate on a variety of ngram sizes (e.g. trigrams and four-grams)\n",
